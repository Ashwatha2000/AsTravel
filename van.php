        <h2>WORLD</h2>
        <h4>PVH Corp., formerly known as the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, is an American clothing company which owns brands such as Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, Warner's, Olga, True & Co., and Geoffrey Beene. The company also licenses brands such as BCBG Max Azria, Chaps (men's dress shirts until 2020), Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud, Michael Kors, and Speedo (the latter under an exclusive perpetual license from Speedo International for the North American market).[2] PVH is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve.</h4>

              <h2>HISTORY</h2>
              <h4>The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded the shirt manufacturing company D. Jones & Sons, c. 1857.[7] Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with M. Phillips & Sons in 1907 under the name Phillips-Jones[8] after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen), and in the subsequent acquisition of Van Heusen by Phillips-Jones and its renaming to Phillips-Van Heusen in 1957.[9] In 2011, Phillips-Van Heusen is renamed to PVH.[10]

The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[11] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[12]

After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[13] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[14]

On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[15] In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March  2011 the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.

In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only). In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[16]

PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[12]

In 2017 Forbes ranked PVH, 25 out of 890 companies on the "Just company" list.[17]

In March 2017, PVH acquired lingerie brand True & Co.[18]

In June 2018, PVH acquired the Geoffrey Beene clothing brand, which PVH previously produced under license.[19] On August 28, 2018, PVH announced that it would expand the Izod brand to portions of Europe beginning with the Fall/Winter 2018 collection.</h4>
