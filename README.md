I developed a travel, fashion, and food website during my introduction to HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

This project began as part of my web development course at PSG College of Technology, inspired by MakeMyTrip and its role in vacation booking.

I initially built the front-end of the website and later integrated PHP with MySQL, using phpMyAdmin to manage the database.
The system stored user data, including browsing history, login/sign-in details, and static website content, ensuring a seamless user experience.
