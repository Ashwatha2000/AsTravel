I developed a travel, fashion, and food website during my introduction to HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

This project began as part of my web development course at PSG College of Technology, inspired by MakeMyTrip and its role in vacation booking.

I initially built the front-end of the website and later integrated PHP with MySQL, using phpMyAdmin to manage the database. The system stored user data, including browsing history, login/sign-in details, and static website content, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Looking back, you’ll notice that I was new to project development, as the file structure is quite messy—all images are placed alongside the PHP files instead of being organized in an image folder. However, this project stands as proof of my career beginnings and reflects my curiosity and passion for web development.
